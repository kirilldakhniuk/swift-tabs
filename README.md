**Swift Tabs** provides an easy way to switch between open tabs.

## Usage
By default, the hot key is set to `ctrl+tab`, which you can change in the Nova settings if you want.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Show relativizePath only when the options have the same filename
- [ ] Create an ability to jump into functions in open tabs
